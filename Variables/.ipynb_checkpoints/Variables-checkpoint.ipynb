    "A <i>variable</i> is a reserved spot in computer memory that stores a particular value or a reference to an object. In Python which is a <i>dynamically-typed language</i> (unlike other statically-typed languages like Java), you can define a variable <code>x</code> to be certain type and then later in your code, it's acceptable to assign an expression of a different type to <code>x</code>).\n",
    "\n",
    "Different data types in Python include numbers (integers and floats), strings, lists, tuples, and dictionaries. This means that the following is valid code and will not error:\n",

    "Variables are useful because they allow you to save your place -- whether a calculated value that you don't want to lose the precision of while retyping, or a pointer to something you might potentially lose in the future. For example, the below is an example of bad coding practice (you should never, ever assign a Python keyword corresponding to a built-in function to another value because that means that you could lose the function in the current environment):\n",

The first output shows exactly what we expect when we type in <code>print</code>: the reference to the associated built-in function.\n",

    "In the second block, we assign <code>print</code> to <code>x</code>. This means that there are now 2 references pointing at the same built-in function, which is why it <code>x(5)</code> doesn't error -- that statement is now equivalent to <code>print(5)</code> for the time being.\n",

    "In the third block, we assign print to 2. This means <code>print</code> is no longer pointing but rather storing the value 2. This is why <code>print(2)</code> errors; <code>print</code> is not a function and <code>2(2)</code> is a statement the computer doesn't know how to interpret.\n",

    "On another note, so far, we've been using a boring <code>x</code> as our variable name. According to good coding practice, it's a better idea to provide more descriptive variable names so that you can reread your code and understand its flow more efficiently, and so that others can read your code for the first time and easily decipher your thought process. For instance, if you're storing the speed of light in a variable, try to call it something like <code>light_speed</code> instead of <code>c</code> (which is something physicists might understand, but even so, the name is not intuitive).\n",

    "- cannot start with a number\n",
    "- can only contain A-z (uppercase and lowercase), 0-9, and the underscore\n",
